## [0.8.4] - 2022-12-09
### Added

### Added
- Now logs time zone settings for both the host and NVR

- Fixed issue where some command logging was not indented
- Fixed issue where the tool could crash when run in a container if /config/database didn't exist

## [0.8.1] - 2022-12-04
version 0.8.0 was used by accident previously and PyPI would not accept it so bumping by one patch version

## [0.8.0] - 2022-12-03
Major internal refactoring. Each task is now its own class and asyncio task.

### Added
- A database of backed up events and where they are stored
- A periodic check for missed events
  - This will also ensure past events before the tool was used are backed up, up until the retention period

### Fixed
- Pruning is no longer done based on file timestamps, the database is used instead. The tool will no longer delete files it didn't create.
- Pruning now runs much more frequently (every minute) so retention periods of less than a day are now possible.
